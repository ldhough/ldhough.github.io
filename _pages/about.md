I am a first year CS PhD student at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) in the [Parallel Software and Systems Group](https://pssg.cs.umd.edu). I earned by Bachelors of Science in CS from [Stetson University](https://www.stetson.edu/) in 2021. After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked full-time as a software engineer at [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com) from 2021-2022, and [i2k Connect](https://i2kconnect.com) from 2022-2024.

At UMD, I am currently focused in researching how best to utilize HPC resources for ML inference.

Outside of work I enjoy LEGO, hiking, fantasy novels, video games, and retro computing.
